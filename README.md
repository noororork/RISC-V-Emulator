# RISC-V Emulator in C++

## üìñ Overview
This project is a **RISC-V emulator written in C++**.  
It loads a machine program from a hex file, simulates memory and registers, decodes instructions, and executes them as a real CPU would.  

The emulator fetches 32-bit instructions from memory, decodes them according to the RISC-V ISA, and updates registers, memory, and the program counter ‚Äî replicating the instruction cycle of a processor.  

This project is still in the production stage, so not all features are complete- see next steps below.

## üöÄ Features
- Load program data from **hex files** into simulated memory
- Simulate **32 general-purpose RISC-V registers**
- Support for core instructions such as:
  - **Arithmetic/logic** (e.g., `addi`, `add`)
  - **Memory access** (`lw`, `sw`)
  - **Control flow** (`beq`, `jal`(not completed yet))
- Instruction **fetch ‚Üí decode ‚Üí execute** pipeline
- Proper handling of **sign-extension**, **immediate fields**, and **bit masking**
- Enforced **x0 hardwired to zero** rule
- Memory abstraction for both instructions and data
- PC (program counter) simulation

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Compile the project:
    `g++ src/*.cpp src/instructions/*.cpp -Iinclude -o main.exe`

## üå± Next stages
Currently the project is in the late developement stages, my next steps will be to implement j instructions and system instructions.

After that I will work on improving implementation to make it sleeker and to use better coding practice. I plan to implement pointer-arithmetic rather than basic indexing when using the program counter to load and execute instructions, as well as using enums for the different bit-codes of instructions.

Please note that most testing hasn't occurred past loading the instructions and translating it to its specific instruction function. Currently uses main method which makes a one-instruction hex file, but once I have completed implementation of all instructions I will be able to load in full hex files to test on. This means that I have yet to complete exception-handling, but I plan to get the whole model working smoothly as my next steps.

## üìå Takeaways

This project demonstrates both software engineering skills and a strong understanding of computer architecture / embedded systems.
It bridges the gap between theory (ISA, CPU design) and practice (implementing an emulator in C++), showing the ability to work close to the hardware/software boundary.
